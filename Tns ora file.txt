Update to the new joinees

When ever we make some changes to the tnsnames.ora on G drive, before you edit the file you must be aware that you should make a backup of the existing tnsnames.ora file by COPYING it to G:\oracle\orant\NETWORK\ADMIN\Bkup tnsnames.ora.

Then, you should be running the above mentioned script (REPTNS.bat), by double clicking. This would push the modified file to various locations. Please run this after peak hrs/business hrs as it would lock the tnsnames.ora file until the .bat gets over.
