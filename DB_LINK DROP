So we would have to clear entries from link$ dictionary table.

Please follow the below instructions:

1- Take a backup of the database, so that you can restore and recover the database to the current point in time in case the dictionary patching goes wrong

2- Take backup of the link$ table

SQL> Create table link_salvage as select * from link$ ;

3- Run the next query to list the owner# for RPT_BRM_CRM link

SQL> select owner#, name from link$ where name='RPT_BRM_CRM_1';

4- Note the user# returned for the user BRM01

SQL> select user#, name from user$ where name='BRM01';

5- Delete the problematic dblink

SQL> delete from sys.link$ where name='RPT_BRM_CRM_1' and owner#=from step 4;
This should delete two rows based on the select statement output. If its deleting more rows update the SR do a rollback immediately.
If its reporting same number of rows as select go to next step
6- Verify if it is deleted
SQL> select * from dba_db_links where db_link like '%RPT_BRM_CRM%' and host='prod';

SQL> commit;

------

SQL> select * from dba_db_links where db_link like '%RPT_BRM_CRM%';
