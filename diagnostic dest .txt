For changing the diagnostic dest below is an example 

Example on pmoc2s db

a) Copy diag directory to /ora_trc_01/pmoc2s/

cp -R /oracle/admin/pmoc2s/diag /ora_trc_01/pmoc2s/.


b) Edit the diagnostic_dest param dynamically to /ora_trc_01/pmoc2s

sql> alter system set diagnostic_dest='/ora_trc_01/pmoc2s' scope=memory;


c) Check if alert_pmoc2s.log on the new location is getting appended, it should work as we had changed it to new location on above step

/ora_trc_01/pmoc2s/diag/rdbms/pmoc2s/pmoc2s/trace/alert_pmoc2s.log


d) Remove /oracle/admin/pmoc2s/diag

cd /oracle/admin/pmoc2s/

rm -rf diag

f) Create link file on /oracle/admin/pmoc2s


cd /oracle/admin/pmoc2s

ln -s /ora_trc_01/pmoc2s/diag


g) Change the param on dictionary

alter system set diagnostic_dest='/oracle/admin/pmoc2s' scope=both;


h) check if alert_pmoc2s.log is getting appended


3) Backup of these databases should be taken care as they should fall into regular TWS job schedules.
